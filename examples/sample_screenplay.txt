FADE IN:

EXT. GARDEN - DAY

A beautiful garden in full bloom. Spring flowers dance in the gentle breeze. 

ALICE (20s), wearing a simple summer dress, walks slowly through the garden path, admiring the colorful display.

ALICE
What a perfectly lovely day.

She stops to smell a red rose. The scent brings a smile to her face.

ALICE (CONT'D)
Mother was right. This garden is truly magical.

A BUTTERFLY lands on her shoulder. Alice stands perfectly still, not wanting to disturb it.

ALICE (CONT'D)
Hello there, little friend.

The butterfly flies away. Alice continues her walk.

                                                          CUT TO:

INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

A cozy kitchen with morning sunlight streaming through lace curtains. 

Alice enters through the back door, carrying a small bouquet of wildflowers.

ALICE
I'm home!

MOTHER (50s), a warm woman with flour-dusted hands, looks up from her bread making.

MOTHER
How was your walk, dear?

ALICE
Wonderful. The garden is absolutely perfect today.

Alice places the flowers in a vase on the kitchen table.

MOTHER
Those are beautiful. Just like my daughter.

ALICE
(blushing)
Oh, Mother.

MOTHER
Lunch will be ready soon. Why don't you wash up?

ALICE
Of course.

Alice heads toward the stairs.

                                                          CUT TO:

INT. HOUSE - ALICE'S BEDROOM - DAY

A small, tidy bedroom with floral wallpaper and lace curtains matching the kitchen.

Alice sits at her vanity, brushing her hair and humming softly. She looks at herself in the mirror.

ALICE
(to her reflection)
What adventures await today?

She sets down the brush and heads downstairs.

                                                       FADE OUT.
