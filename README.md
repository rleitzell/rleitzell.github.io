## Quick Start

### Online Usage
Visit the live demo at: [https://rleitzell.github.io](https://rleitzell.github.io)

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rleitzell/rleitzell.github.io.git
   cd rleitzell.github.io
   ```

2. Start a local web server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   # or
   npx http-server
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

### Main Application
1. **Upload Screenplay**: Drag and drop a PDF screenplay file or click to select
2. **Processing**: Watch real-time progress as the tool extracts and analyzes content
3. **Review Results**: Browse scenes, characters, and locations in tabbed interface
4. **Export Data**: Download analysis as CSV or JSON for further processing

### Interactive Demo
Visit `/demo.html` to see the tool in action with a sample screenplay text.

### Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite at `/tests/` to verify functionality.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Modules
- **`models.js`**: Data models for Scene, Character, and Location entities
- **`textProcessor.js`**: Text parsing and scene extraction logic
- **`pdfExtractor.js`**: PDF processing using PDF.js library
- **`sceneAnalyzer.js`**: Scene analysis and aggregation engine
- **`exportUtils.js`**: Data export utilities for CSV/JSON/XML
- **`main.js`**: Main application controller and UI logic

### Data Models

#### Scene
```javascript
{
  id: "deterministic-hash",
  number: 1,
  slugline: "INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY",
  location: "COFFEE SHOP",
  timeOfDay: "DAY",
  characters: ["SARAH", "MIKE"],
  content: "Scene dialogue and action...",
  estimatedLength: 2, // in 1/8 page units
  pageNumber: 1
}
```

#### Character
```javascript
{
  name: "SARAH",
  scenes: ["scene-id-1", "scene-id-2"],
  totalAppearances: 2
}
```

#### Location
```javascript
{
  name: "COFFEE SHOP",
  scenes: ["scene-id-1", "scene-id-2"],
  totalUses: 2
}
```

## Analysis Features

### Scene Detection
- Recognizes standard slugline formats (INT./EXT. LOCATION - TIME)
- Handles scene numbers and variations
- Processes multiple screenplay formatting styles
- Resolves duplicate scene numbers automatically

### Character Extraction
- Identifies character names from dialogue formatting
- Filters out non-character elements (camera directions, etc.)
- Tracks character appearances across scenes
- Provides character-based scene analysis

### Location Analysis
- Extracts locations from sluglines
- Normalizes location names
- Tracks location usage frequency
- Supports location-based filtering

### Export Capabilities
- **CSV Export**: Scenes, characters, and locations as separate CSV files
- **JSON Export**: Complete analysis data in structured format
- **XML Export**: Alternative structured format
- **Batch Export**: Download multiple formats simultaneously

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite covering:
- Data model functionality
- Text processing algorithms
- Scene analysis logic
- Export utilities
- Integration scenarios

Run tests by visiting `/tests/` in your browser.
